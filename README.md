# classification-challenge
This project implements a spam detection system for an Internet Service Provider to improve their email filtering sustem for its customers. I have been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: soam and not spam. This model accurately detects spam emails.

## Functions:
## Data Preprocessing
- Features (`X`) and labels (`y`) are separated.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Scale the features using `StandardScaler`.
## Model Training
- Create a logistic regression model.
- Create a random forest model.
## Model Evaluation
- Predictions on the test data are made.
- Accuracy scores for both models are calculated.
- The Random Forest Classifier outperformed the Logistic Regression Model (Random Forest Classifier accuracy is 96.70& Vs. the Logistic Regression model accuracy is 92.88%).

## Summary:
The project showcases
